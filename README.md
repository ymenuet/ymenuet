### Hi there 👋

#### About me
- ☝️ I am a **full-stack web developer** from France, living in Mexico City.
- 💪 I have experience working with the **MERN stack**, as you can see in my pinned repos, but I also know a bit of PHP and SQL.
- ✌️ After several project management experiences as an engineer in the software industry, I decided to learn coding and that was one of the best decisions of my life. I have always been very **rigorous and logical** in my way of living and web development perfectly matches these characteristics. They allow me to produce **clean and reusable code** for applications to work smoothly.
- 👷 I like to **appropriate and involve myself** a lot on the projects I work on, so that developing them and seeing the result is always a **trhilling and rewarding experience**.
- 👂 I love the fact that the web development community is so **helpful** and open to everyone. I **enjoy learning** from more experienced developers and **take satisfaction in helping** colleagues in need.

#### My projects
- ⚽ [Pronogeeks](https://github.com/ymenuet/pronogeeks) is a web application developped with Node.js and React.js. It allows its users to make bets on French football league's results and compete against one another. Some small details are still in development but the app will soon be launched. Stay tuned!
- 😷 [KLEEN](https://github.com/ymenuet/KLEEN) is a web application developped using Node.js along with Express.js, Handlebars and Mongoose. Its users can rate the experience they had in any public place, in regards to the respect of the sanitary measures they observed there (use of facemasks, respects of physical distancing, soap available...).
- 🎮 [COVIDeojuego](https://github.com/ymenuet/COVIDeojuego) is a videogame developped using pure Javascript. The goal is to save the world from COVID, playing as one of our world's leader.

#### My goals
- 📚 My philosophy is to **keep learning, always**. The web development world requires its participants to do so because of the continuously evolving technologies, and I enjoy it. After consolidating my knowledge on React.js, I plan on learning React Native and apply it on the Pronogeeks app, for it to be available as a mobile app as well. I am also open to **learning new technologies and languages**.
- 🥅 I aspire to work on projects and products that are **relevant and innovating**, to be a part of something **big and meaningful**. I currently am open to job opportunities.
